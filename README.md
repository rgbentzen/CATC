## Carrier of Ammunitions Training Course

### Purpose 
Online training course for certification of CIC Officers to transport ammunitions in vehicles.  This course had to meet Ministry of Transportation approval.

### Distribution
	•	English and French, for National access via the Defence Learning Network
	•	Expected official duration of 30 minutes, but typically 1.5 contact hours

### Roles/Responsibility
I designed and developed the course content with the Content Development Officer (CDO) and a subject matter expert from concept to implementation. I expanded the existing templates to include new layouts for more interactivity and simpler navigation.  I was also responsibility for asset creation.

### Approach
I developed with Trivantis Publisher v11, and published as SCORM modules for delivery on Saba LMS.  Exported to HTML for Portfolio review.  
This course contains the following attributes:
	•	controlled navigation aspects
	•	table of contents “on-demand pop-up”
	•	mini-lesson for the Hazardous Materials Placards  
	•	formative quiz
	•	summative test (multiple attempts are permitted)
